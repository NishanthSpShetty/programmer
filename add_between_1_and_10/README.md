A program to perform add (+) operation on given input numbers which is in range of 1 and 10(inclusive)

 If your number is missing please ask programmer to write another program for you

 This program is generated for leinigen tools, so you can use lein to pretty much for anything lein does

```

 Issues doesnt matter here, I urge you to ignore them, but still if you want to report, report the `programmer` the `master`
